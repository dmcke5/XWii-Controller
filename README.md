# Xii-U Controller
An Xbox One style controller with a Wii U layout!

![Alt text](Title.png "Xii-U Controller")

The Wii U gamepad layout is a fan-favourite for many gamers yet it is rarely used in the current generation of controllers. This open source project brings the Wii-U layout back but in a shape more akin to an Xbox controller and provides you with a cool piece of tech that you can be proud to say you built yourself!

Features:
- Wii-U controller layout
- Hall Effect Joysticks
- Hall Effect Triggers
- Rumble
- Xinput Compatible
- RGB Status indicator home button

For now, this controller is wired only but I plan to add a wireless version of the design at some point in the future!
